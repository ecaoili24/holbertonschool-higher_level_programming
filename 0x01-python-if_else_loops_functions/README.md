- How to use the if, if ... else statements
- How to use comments
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use the while and for loops
- How is Python’s for different from C‘s?
- How to use the break and continues statements
- How to use else clauses on loops
- What does the pass statement do, and when to use it
- How to use range
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What does return a function that does not use any return statement
- Scope of variables
- What’s a traceback
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

# Requirements

## Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- The code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)

## C Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS _ Programs and functions compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- Code follows the Betty style. It is checked by using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- No use global variables
- Prototypes of all your functions are included in the header file called lists.h

14. Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercaseand uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.
15. Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
