1. Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
2. Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
3. Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
4.Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
5. Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string
6. Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.
7. Write a function that adds 2 tuples.
