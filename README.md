# Higher Level Programming in Python

The following repository covers programs written in Python for the Higher Level Programming curriculum at Holberton School.

## What Sets Holberton Students Apart

At Holberton, students learn by doing and we collaborate with one another to learn computer science concepts and programming. 

| Key Qualities | Why? |
| --- | --- |
| Full-Stack engineers | The curriculum covers low-level and high-level programming, algorithms, and systems engineering. Students know more than one programming language.
| Soft Skills | Implemented through stand up presentations and technical writing. Students practice project management and collaboration through group projects |
| Adaptable | Students learn how to learn, therefore, they can pick up new skills and tools easily within any environment. They understand the grit and resilence that comes with becoming exceptional. |
